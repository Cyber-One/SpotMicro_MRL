# 1) Spot Micro
This dog looks similar to the Boston Dynamic four legged robot named spot.
This version was created by KDY0523 and named Spotmicro after the Boston Dynamics robot.

Already there have been other creators out there modifying the design to change or add features, so you know I will be looking at those as well.
In the original design, an ArduinoMega 2560 was used to run Spotmicro, however there are mods to allow the use of a Raspberry Pi, so this is the way I will be going :-)

The build of Spot Micro is simple enough, 4 legs, 3 joints in each leg and a fixed body shape.
The project will hopefully help teach us how to make a quadraped robot walk and navigate about itâ€™s environment.
Let break the project down to building the hardware and then the software.
