# SpotMicro_MRL
This dog looks similar to the Boston Dynamic four legged robot named spot.
This version was created by KDY0523 and named Spotmicro after the Boston Dynamics robot.

Already there have been other creators out there modifying the design to change or add features, so you know I will be looking at those as well.
In the original design, an ArduinoMega 2560 was used to run Spotmicro, however there are mods to allow the use of a Raspberry Pi, so this is the way I will be going :-)

The Parts list.txt file contains a list of the different locations and creators where I found these files and the files I used from those uploads.

The system will be running on My Robot Lab, available from http://myrobotlab.org/
